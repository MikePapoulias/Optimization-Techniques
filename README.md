Implementation of various optimization methods on convex functions to find their minimum point using the Matlab simulation environment.

# Description
In this assignment, written in Matlab code, we implement specific algorithms from Optimization Techniques on convex functions of one or multiple variables, aiming to find their minimum point.

In the first part of the assignment, the Bisection Method, the Golden Section Method, the Fibonacci Method, and the Bisection Method using derivatives are applied sequentially to convex functions of a single variable within a specific interval.

The second part aims to minimize functions of multiple variables using derivative-based methods, specifically the Steepest Descent Method, Newton's Method, and the Levenberg-Marquardt Method.

In the third and final part, we focus on the Steepest Descent Method with projection, where the initial search space for the minimum point is predefined in rectangular sets.
